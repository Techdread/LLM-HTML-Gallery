1. Three Design Concepts (in the HTML artifact):

Gallery Grid: Best for browsing many examples quickly
Side-by-Side Documentation: Perfect for learning, shows prompt + code + preview
Minimal Showcase: Clean, focused on the visual output

2. A Simple Viewer Component that's perfect for your needs:
Key Features:

🎯 Focused on Display: No editing capabilities - just viewing
🖼️ Preview + Code: Toggle between preview-only and split view
🔍 Metadata Display: Shows model, prompt, timestamp, and tags
🚀 Performance: Uses data URLs to avoid server requests
🛡️ Security: Proper iframe sandboxing for untrusted code
📱 Responsive: Works on mobile and desktop
🎨 Dark Mode Ready: Supports light/dark themes
🔗 Export Options: Copy code, open in new tab, fullscreen view

Why This is Better Than the Original Component:

No Monaco Editor - You don't need editing, so no heavy dependencies
Simpler State Management - Just show/hide code and fullscreen
Metadata First - Designed specifically for documenting LLM outputs
Lightweight - Much smaller bundle size
Purpose-Built - Exactly what you need for a gallery site
